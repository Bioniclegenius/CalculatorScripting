Note: This file should be updated during every commit. It should explain what is accomplished, and what is left to do.

Error-Checking: Always in-progress, but should have a significant number of errors caught at this point.

Expression Parsing: Mostly done. Inferred multiplication with parentheses and variables is successful. Needs more exhaustive testing and checking.

Evaluation: The beginnings of exponentiation are working. So far, only will do it if two numerically evaluated numbers are on either side of the operation.
